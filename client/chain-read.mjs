// Chain reads a caller makes itself (EpisteryChainReads, Proposal A).
// Browser-servable and Node-importable, like storage-message.mjs: it takes ethers
// v5 from the caller or from globalThis.
//
// Two things live here:
//
//   isChainReadFailure(e) — did the read FAIL, or did the chain ANSWER? A failed
//     read means "ask again"; a false or a revert means "no". Conflating them is
//     what let a provider outage read as a rejection (connect.mjs, PR #37, which
//     now imports it from here).
//
//   chainReader({ rpcs, quorum, chainId }) — ATTESTATION reads: facts a caller acts
//     on as verified (who may seat a device in a group, who may write, whether an
//     address holds code, any view a caller names). `rpcs` are the chain's
//     attestation endpoints — OWNED nodes only (attestationConfig() in the chain
//     registry, which also supplies `quorum`). An answer is asserted k-of-n, like a
//     multisig: it stands when `quorum` nodes give it (default a majority — 1 of 1,
//     2 of 3), so one jammed node neither blocks the read nor decides it. Otherwise
//     the read is refused — CHAIN_DISAGREES or CHAIN_UNREACHABLE — never guessed,
//     and never answered by a foreign gateway. Today the operator runs the only
//     node; each independent node added is one more that a lie must get past.
//     A node answers only while its head is FRESH: before its answer counts, its
//     latest block must be younger than `maxHeadAgeMs` (2 minutes; Polygon seals a
//     block every 2 seconds). A node whose chain has stopped answers every read
//     confidently from an old world — balances, roles, seats, all hours out of
//     date and all "correct" by its own book — and at quorum 1 that is the whole
//     answer. Stale is a non-answer, like down: the read is refused, never served
//     from the past. (2026-10-01: an owned node sat 3.5 hours behind a hardfork
//     while every console balance read it as current.)
//
// The rules are the relay's storage-auth rules (the relay still implements them
// separately), so a member and the relay reach the same verdict from the same chain:
//   rivet : isAuthorized(addr) on the contract, or — an identity admitted as a
//           signer vouching for its own rivet — any contract in getRivets() whose
//           isAuthorized(addr) is true
//   role  : roleOf(section, addr); an identity that vouches for addr lends it its
//           own role (the credential's `identity`)

// A revert is an answer of nothing, however the node reports it. A node that
// reports a revert as a JSON-RPC error reaches ethers as a CALL_EXCEPTION with
// its bytes (classified below as an answer, not a failure). A node that returns
// the same bytes as the call's RESULT reaches us as a string — Error(string) or
// Panic(uint256) bytes that decodeFunctionResult would then throw on, as if the
// chain had failed to answer. Both are the one thing: the contract reverted.

// ethers v5 pitfall: when an endpoint returns a non-result (an HTTP 403, a rate
// limit) ethers does not surface a transport error for an eth_call — it fabricates
// a CALL_EXCEPTION with data "0x", indistinguishable at a glance from a revert. That
// shape (no revert bytes, and/or a transport error nested in e.error) is a read
// failure, not an answer.
